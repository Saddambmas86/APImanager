Prompt to Build an API Saver & Tester App
"Create a modern web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a JS framework like React if needed) that allows users to:

Save multiple API endpoints with custom names and descriptions.

Organize APIs into folders or categories.

Enter HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Add custom headers and request body (for POST/PUT).

Send API requests directly and display the full response (status code, headers, body).

Save response history for each API.

Support authentication headers (e.g., Bearer tokens).

Allow exporting/importing API collections as JSON.

Clean, minimal UI with light/dark mode toggle.

Optionally, add basic error handling and response time tracking."
